# A-flappy-bird-game
The flappy bird is implemented using python (pygame package). This involves a bird that the player can control. The player has to save the bird from colliding with the hurdles like pipes. Each time the bird passes through the pipes, the score gets incremented by one. The game ends when the bird collides with the pipes.
